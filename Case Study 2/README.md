**1. How many subjects are currently available?**

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT className) as AVAILABLE_SUBJECTS 
FROM Class;

````

#### Steps:

**2. What is the highest and lowest grade of student 2018-2001A?**

````sql
SELECT 
  MIN(grade) as HIGHEST_GRADE, 
  MAX(grade) as LOWEST_GRADE 
FROM Enrollment 
WHERE Enrollment.studID = '2018-2001A';

````

#### Steps:
 - Filter records for student 2018-2001A.
 - Use MIN() to capture the best grade (lowest value since 1.0 is highest).
 - Use MAX() to capture the worst grade.

#### Answer:
| HIGHEST_GRADE | LOWEST_GRADE |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| 1.2           | 1.5          |

- Shows the highest and lowest grade recorded

**3. What is the GPA and total grade for student 2020-001A?**

````sql
SELECT 
  AVG(grade) as GPA, 
  SUM(grade) as TOTAL_GRADE 
FROM Enrollment 
WHERE Enrollment.studID = '2020-001A';
````

#### Steps:
- Filter enrollment records for the given student.
- Use AVG() to compute GPA.
- Use SUM() to compute total grade.

#### Answer:
| GPA | TOTAL_GRADE |
| --- | ----------- |
|     |             |
